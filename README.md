# ðŸš€Spaceschip-MiniGame (Developed by Enzo Rodrigues)
Proposal: The project consists of a direct game, where the player goes through a certain route in which he cannot be reached by the enemy ship of the opponents.

Improvements: The game's logic is still not perfect, not having a finalization and a way to restart if the player loses, however, it was developed with the aim of learning about the java interface and its libraries
